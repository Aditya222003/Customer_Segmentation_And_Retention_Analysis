# Customer_Segmentation_And_Retention_Analysis
Tis is a high end Data Science and Analytics Project which deals with the thousands of customer data of E-commerce sites which has be segmented and churned using the Machine Learning Algorithms and has made the Chrun Analysis using 5 different different algorithms.

Following are the Algorithms inplemented : 
1 - Z score 
2 - Decicision Tree Selection Algorithm  
    2.a - Using GINI Index factor
    2.b - Using Entropy factor
3 - Random Forest Algorithm 
4 - Logistic Regression Algrithm 
5 - Kmeans Clustering Algorithm 
6 - Kth Nearest Neighbour Algorithm (KNN)


Project has also done all the comparative study of the Algorithm and has recieved the highest accuracy to the Random Forest Algorithm with 97% accuracy and lowest to the Logistic regression with 76%

This project was build under Guidance of : 
Prof Archana Patil
